## Import

```ts
import { Toast, useToast } from '@fewangsit/wangsvue';
```

## Configuration

Before using Toast, you need to register the ToastService in your application. Add this to your main app file or plugin:

```ts
import { ToastService } from 'primevue/toastservice'

// In your main.ts or plugin file
app.use(ToastService)
```

This makes the toast system available globally throughout your application, allowing the `useToast()` composable to work properly.

## Basic
