::component-demo{src="dialogform/AsideRight"}
::

## Confirm Dialog
Demonstrates the confirm slot using DialogConfirm component. Shows a confirmation dialog before submitting the form, after validation passes.

When using the confirm slot, the form submission flow changes:
1. User fills form and clicks submit button
2. Form validation runs (if configured)
3. If validation passes, the confirm slot is triggered
4. The slot receives `{ visible, hide, submit }` props:
   - `visible`: boolean to control confirm dialog visibility
   - `hide`: function to close the confirm dialog
   - `submit`: function that accepts your form submission handler
5. When user confirms, call `submit(yourSubmitFunction)` to process the form
6. When user cancels, call `hide()` to close the confirm dialog

**Note:** When using the confirm slot, the `@submit` event is not emitted. The form submission is handled entirely through the confirm slot.
